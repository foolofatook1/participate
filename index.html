    <p>This is a game based on The Lumiere Brothers' film, <i>Workers Leaving The Lumiere Factory</i>. The entirety of the film consists of a slew of workers, mainly women, leaving the factory. The most exciting aspect of this film is when a man on a bicycle and a dog exit the Factory. This is to say that all the other people exiting the factory are primarily women dressed almost identically, or with little variation. This aspect of the film coupled with the factory setting rendered the idea of a lemmings-type game. I'm not completely sure if this is a commonly used euphamism, but growing up I often heard the term "lemmings" used in reference to workers who's positions were of the "cog-in-a-machine" type. I'm curious as to why so many women worked in the factory, and I find the use of these women as "lemmings" attempting to escape the factory to be an interesting, and thought provoking idea for a game.</p>
    <p>I'm essentialy going to recycle the primary lemming abilities from the original game. These being to dig, build a staircase, mine through a wall, and act as a traffic guard to stop other lemmings from passing. There is a preset start and end point to the level. At the start of the game a round of lemmings will come out automatically. They will walk until they either fall or hit a wall. If they fall, depending on the height, they could die. If they hit a wall &#40;or a traffic guard lemming&#41;, they will turn around. To overcome obstacles within the level the player must assign abbilities to the lemmings. This is done by clicking on a lemming, and then clicking the key that corresponds to the ability you would like them to have.</p>
